# Project Scope of Works:

## Project Overview
NeuroVision is a deep learning-powered application that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze MRI scans and detect brain tumors. Designed to support early diagnosis and assist medical professionals, the project focuses on automating the identification of abnormalities in brain images. The final model will be deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload MRI images and receive real-time predictions.

## Project Objectives
1. **Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
- Acquire MRI scan images.
- Preprocess images by normalizing, resizing, and applying enhancements to standardize input data.

2. **Model Development:**
- Build a CNN-based deep learning model using frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
- Utilize transfer learning or custom architectures to classify scans as tumor-positive or tumor-negative.
- Evaluate model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Model Deployment:**
- Develop an interactive Streamlit application that enables users to upload MRI scans and view predictions.
- Provide additional outputs such as model confidence scores and optional visual explanations (e.g., Grad-CAM) for enhanced interpretability.

## Workflow

### **Phase 1: Setup (1 Week)**
- Setup GitHub repo and project folders
- Setup virtual environment and respective libraries

### **Phase 2: Data Preprocessing (1 Week)**
- Download the Brain MRI Scans dataset.
- Explore and preprocess the dataset:
  - Resize images to a uniform size.
  - Normalize pixel values for faster model convergence.
  - Perform data augmentation to improve model generalization.

### **Phase 3: Model Development (2 Weeks)**
- Design and implement a CNN architecture tailored for brain tumor classification.
- Train the model using the preprocessed dataset, leveraging transfer learning or custom techniques as needed.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Fine-tune the model for optimal performance.

### **Phase 4: Deployment (1 Week)**
- Build a Streamlit app to:
  - Allow users to upload images.
  - Display the model's predictions.
